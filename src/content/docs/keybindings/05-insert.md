In insert mode, nearly all keystrokes will go to the prompt input field. There are a few exceptions:

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `Ctrl+M` | Open model selection dialog (default models) |
| `Ctrl+m` | Open model selection dialog (current chat models) |
| `Enter` | Submit prompt |
| `Esc` | Back to normal mode |
